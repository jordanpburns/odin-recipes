    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The allrecipes description of this recipe is rather sparse. It reads:
            "A tasty, low carb, vegan ice cream. Enjoy!" The picture above isn't
            even from the all recipes page; it's taken from lovingitvegan. I suppose
            we'll just have to let this vegan ice cream recipe speak for itself.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>To be honest I don't really like this recipe so I've made some changes from the original.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 14 ounce can of cocnut milk</li>
                <li>1 14 ounce can of coconut cream</li>
                <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ground espresso beans</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons cocoa powder</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>4 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir cocnut milk, cocnut cream, brown sugar and white sugar together
                    in a saucepan. Cook on medium low heat until sugar dissolves. Add coffee powder
                    cocoa and vanilla extract. Whisk until fully combined.
                </li>
                <li>Remove 2 tablespoons of the coconut mixture. Whisk with cornstarch in a bowl
                    to make a slurry. Pour back into the coconut mixture. Stir until slurry is evenly 
                    distributed.

                <li>Refridgerate until completely chilled, 3 hours to overnight</li>
                <li>Freeze 8 hours to overnight</li>
            </ol>
