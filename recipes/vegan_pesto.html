        garlic cloves and pine nuts adorn the marble around the bowl. Two small
        basil leaves and three pine nuts gently decorate the surface of the

        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>According to allrecipes.com, where I found this
                recipe, this vegan pesto is a <em>classic recipe</em>
                that the author <strong>uses</strong> and 
                <strong>loves</strong>. The main difference between this 
                recipe and a non vegan pesto is the use of nutritional
                yeast rather than parmesean cheese. I have actually made a 
                similar recipe and it is very good on pastas, bread, sandwhiches,
                etc. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                I also reccomend finishing off a dish with sundried tomatoes
                in addition to this great vegan pesto. This recipes makes 
                16 servings. Source: <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/79450/yummy-vegan-pesto-classico/
